# vam-sdlc — Claude Code plugin

20 skills + 11 plugin-namespaced agents for a full ideation → ship pipeline with Claude.

- **12-stage backbone** — covers the entire cycle from codebase scan to merge & changelog.
- **7 cross-cutting utilities** — called ad-hoc at any stage (classify-size, fix-term, decide-adr, roadmap, prepare-design-spec, verify-ui, user-documentation).
- **1 ideation skill** — interview (runs researcher / strategist / analyst / devils-advocate agents).
- **11 agents** — dispatched as `vam-sdlc:<name>` from inside skills; model/effort policy in `skills/_shared/agent-roster.md`.
- **10 shared references** — `skills/_shared/` files consumed by multiple skills (surfaces, handoff, mermaid-check, depth-dial, …).

Each skill is a self-contained folder under `skills/<name>/` — `SKILL.md` (protocol + DoD + anti-patterns), optional `templates/` (skeletons the skill copies into `docs/features/<slug>/`), optional `references/` (mini-guides the skill reads at specific protocol steps).

## Install

Shipped from the `vam-ai-units` marketplace at the root of this repo:

```
/plugin marketplace add C:/Work/Personal/ai-units
/plugin install vam-sdlc@vam-ai-units
```

Verify: `/plugin` lists `vam-sdlc` as enabled, and `/vam-sdlc:interview` (or any other slash-trigger below) appears in the slash menu.

Vendored from [genkovich/agentic-engineering-course](https://github.com/genkovich/agentic-engineering-course) `sdlc/plugin` (upstream v4.5.1, MIT) and renamed to the `vam-sdlc` namespace.

## Skill order — full backbone (12 stages)

> Each stage reads the previous stage's artefacts. The `map-architecture` scan happens **once** at the start; later stages read `docs/architecture-map.md` instead of re-scanning. Cross-cutting utilities (`fix-term`, `classify-size`, `decide-adr`, `roadmap`, `prepare-design-spec`, `verify-ui`) are called ad-hoc, not in sequence.

| Stage | Skill | Command | Output |
|------:|-------|---------|--------|
| 00 | [`map-architecture`](skills/map-architecture/SKILL.md) | `/vam-sdlc:map-architecture` | `docs/architecture-map.md` (repo-root); greenfield → scaffold `tasks.json` |

| 15 | [`plan-tests`](skills/plan-tests/SKILL.md) | `/vam-sdlc:plan-tests` | `docs/features/<slug>/test-plan.md` (surface-gated tiers; generic, no hardcoded tools) |
| 17 | [`implement-tasks`](skills/implement-tasks/SKILL.md) | `/vam-sdlc:implement-tasks` | committed TDD code + tests + updated `tracker.md`; promotes staged migrations |

## Agents

11 agents are dispatched as `vam-sdlc:<name>` from inside skills — never called directly by the user. Model/effort policy for each agent lives in [`skills/_shared/agent-roster.md`](skills/_shared/agent-roster.md).

| Agent | Role | Dispatched from |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `vam-sdlc:explorer` | Fast codebase scan (haiku) | map-architecture |
| `vam-sdlc:researcher` | Source research (sonnet) | interview |
| `vam-sdlc:strategist` | Strategic framing (opus) | interview |
| `vam-sdlc:analyst` | Trade-off analysis (opus) | interview |
| `vam-sdlc:devils-advocate` | Adversarial stress-test (opus) | interview |
| `vam-sdlc:critic` | Clean-context quality review (opus) | write-prd, architecture-design, review-feature |
| `vam-sdlc:test-author` | Test plan generation (sonnet) | plan-tests |
| `vam-sdlc:implementer` | GREEN — make the red test pass (sonnet) | implement-tasks |
| `vam-sdlc:refactor` | REFACTOR — tidy while green, isolated (sonnet) | implement-tasks |
| `vam-sdlc:reviewer` | Final feature review (opus) | review-feature |
| `vam-sdlc:doc-flow` | Per-flow user-doc walk + write (sonnet) | user-documentation |

## Shared mechanisms

`skills/_shared/` contains 10 reference files consumed by multiple skills:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent-roster.md` | Model/effort/agents policy for all 11 agents |
| `ask-style.md` | AskUserQuestion formatting conventions |
| `critic.md` | Critic-phase protocol (clean-context adversarial review) |
| `diagram-presentation.md` | Mermaid diagram rendering and presentation rules |
| `handoff.md` | Stage-handoff block template (every skill ends with one) |
| `interview-depth.md` | Depth-dial (1–5) for the ideation interview |
| `mermaid-check.md` | Mermaid syntax validation checklist |
| `size-matrix.md` | XS/S/M/L/XL classification matrix |
| `socratic-loop.md` | Socratic Q&A loop protocol shared by multiple skills |
| `surfaces.md` | `target_surfaces` taxonomy (web / mobile / api / cli / event / background) |

**Cross-cutting mechanisms:**

- **`target_surfaces`** — declared in `sad.md` frontmatter by `architecture-design`; downstream skills (sequences, api, tasks, plan-tests, review) gate on it instead of re-deriving.
- **`architecture-map.md`** — `map-architecture` scans the codebase once; later stages read it. Carries a §Frontend/UI foundation section so UI work reuses the existing design system.
- **`tasks.json`** — machine-readable DAG (`id, title, layer, deps, acs, dod, files_hint`) at `docs/features/<slug>/tasks/tasks.json`; `implement-tasks` reads it to close the cycle.
- **Staged migrations** — `generate-data-model` writes to `docs/features/<slug>/migrations/`; `implement-tasks` promotes them into the repo's live migrations tree (re-stamping timestamps).
- **TDD engine** — `implement-tasks` runs SELECT → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → GATE → COMMIT; supports sequential / agent-team / dynamic Workflow modes; commit trailers `SDLC-Task` / `SDLC-AC`.
- **Stage-handoff blocks** — every skill ends with a handoff block (from `_shared/handoff.md`) naming the next skill and what to pass forward.
- **Socratic loop** — shared Q&A cadence across write-prd, architecture-design, clarify-prd.
- **Critic phase** — clean-context `vam-sdlc:critic` / `vam-sdlc:reviewer` used in PRD, architecture, and final review to surface blind spots.

## What's inside each skill

Every skill folder has the same anatomy:

- `SKILL.md` — frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `triggers`, `stage`) + the protocol the skill executes + Self-check + anti-patterns. Single source of truth.
- `templates/` *(if the skill copies a skeleton)* — the artefact starter that the skill writes into `docs/features/<slug>/`. Owned by this skill: no other skill copies it.
- `references/` *(if the protocol is long)* — mini-guides loaded at specific protocol steps.

Per-skill specifics (templates + key references):

| Skill | Key files |
|-------|-----------|
| `map-architecture` | no templates — writes `docs/architecture-map.md` directly from codebase scan |
| `interview` | `templates/idea-brief.md` (15 sections); dispatches researcher/strategist/analyst/devils-advocate |
| `write-prd` | `templates/PRD-template.md`; `references/{draft-generation,socratic-loop,critic-phase,critic-prompt,ask-examples,checklist}.md` |
| `clarify-prd` | `references/ambiguity-sweep.md` (tightens PRD in place, no new file) |
| `architecture-design` | `templates/{sad-template,adr-template,c4-context,c4-container,deployment}.md`; `references/{draft-generation,socratic-loop,blast-radius-heuristic,socratic-cadence,c4-mermaid-syntax,…}.md` |
| `complete-sequence-diagrams` | `templates/seq-flow.md` (single-flow shape, embedded inline in SAD §6) |
| `generate-data-model` | `templates/{data-model,rules-migrations-baseline}.md`; staged migrations to `docs/features/<slug>/migrations/`; reads `docs/architecture-map.md` for convention source |
| `api-forge` | `templates/{openapi.yaml,events.md}`; `references/{cli.md,public-api.md,drift-check.md}` (per-surface contracts + drift detection) |
| `break-tasks` | `templates/{_epic,tracker,task}.md`; produces `tasks/tasks.json` machine DAG |
| `plan-tests` | `templates/test-plan.md` |
| `implement-tasks` | reads `tasks/tasks.json`; `references/{tdd-loop,command-detection,settings,…}.md` (×8); promotes staged migrations |
| `review-feature` | `templates/review-template.md`; `references/review-dimensions.md` (AC trace + quality dimensions) |
| `ship-feature` | `templates/{changelog-entry,pr-body}.md`; forge-detect (gh/glab); updates `docs/roadmap.md` |
| `decide-adr` | no own templates — pulls canonical `../architecture-design/templates/adr-template.md` cross-skill |
| `fix-term` | `templates/CONTEXT.md` (lazy bootstrap for the per-feature glossary) |
| `classify-size` | no template — writes a 1-line `.size` file |
| `roadmap` | `templates/roadmap.md` (Now/Next/Later/Shipped tables) |
| `prepare-design-spec` | `templates/design-spec.md`; repository-aware design-entry contract |
| `user-documentation` | `templates/{flow-doc,user-guide-index}.md`; `references/{style-guide,determinism,flow-inventory}.md`; `scripts/{validate-docs.py,replay-screencast.sh}`; dispatches `vam-sdlc:doc-flow` per flow |

## DB exception

`generate-data-model` is a **deliberate partial mirror** of the upstream sdd pipeline. It keeps the course's opinionated DB defaults — audit = `created_at` only (immutable-first); hard delete; no CHECK / TRIGGER / business DEFAULT (DB as "dumb storage"); SQL-first migrations; timestamp-prefixed idempotent filenames. It does **not** adopt sdd's stack-agnostic "detect-the-repo's-DB-philosophy" stance. From the upstream pipeline it borrows only: staged migrations, drift-check, and reading `docs/architecture-map.md` as a convention source.

## Shared templates

Upstream kept a repo-level `document-templates/` folder with snippets that belong to no single skill (`CHANGELOG.md`, `claude-context.md`, `review-checklist.md`, `rollback-plan.md`, `migration-plan.md`, `diagrams/c4-component.md`, plus legacy `SPEC.md` / `arc42.md` / `architecture-brief.md`). It is **not** vendored here — no skill protocol reads it, so it is not needed for the plugin to run. Pull anything you want from upstream by hand.

The one exception: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` is vendored into `skills/fix-term/templates/`, because `fix-term` links to it.

## Conventions

- **Skill = source of truth.** Edit `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` to change skill behaviour; the protocol there is what gets executed.
- **Templates colocated with their owner skill** — single ownership; copying a skill folder gives you a working skill.
- **Mermaid only** for diagrams (C4, sequence, ER, deployment). No PlantUML, no draw.io.
- **One ADR = one decision.** Spawned inline through the blast-radius gate in `architecture-design`; standalone via `decide-adr` for post-hoc cases.
- **Texts in repo, not Confluence.**
- **Feature artifacts at `docs/features/<slug>/`** — repo-root artifacts at `docs/` (architecture-map.md, roadmap.md).

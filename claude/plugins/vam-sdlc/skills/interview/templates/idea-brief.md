# Idea Brief — <feature name>

## 1. Raw idea
<1 paragraph verbatim from user, phase 1>

## 2. Problem
<1-3 sentences, facts/numbers>

## 3. Users
<who suffers, frequency, segments>

## 4. Why now
<trigger: incident/contract/deadline>

## 5. Out of scope
- bullet

## 6. Competitive analysis
| # | Product · URL | Features | Value per feature (1-5) | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <name> · <url> | <features> | <ratings> | <gap> |

Footnotes per row: date and search query used.

## 7. Strategic approaches

### Approach A — <3-5 word name>
- **Thesis** (1 sentence, product language)
- **For whom** (which segment from §3 benefits most)
- **Outcome metric** (1 KPI: baseline → target)
- **Key trade-off** (1 line)
- **Effort signal**: S / M / L
- **Recommended?** ◯ / ●  (filled in §13)

### Approach B — ...
[same structure]

### Approach C — ...
[same structure]

## 8. Multi-perspective feedback

### Engineer
- 3-5 bullets (concerns / value / risks — abstract, NO library or DB names)

### Executive
- 3-5 bullets

### UX-researcher
- 3-5 bullets

### Synthesis matrix
|         | Engineer | Executive | UX |
|---------|:--------:|:---------:|:--:|
| App. A  | +        | +         | 0  |
| App. B  | -        | +         | -  |
| App. C  | 0        | 0         | +  |

6-word justifications in each cell.

## 9. Trade-offs and edge cases

### Trade-offs per approach
| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| A | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... |
| C | ... | ... |

### Edge cases
- 5-8 items

## 10. Risks
- Top devil's advocate attack vector (from phase 8)
- Other identified risks

## 11. RICE — Claude proposed
- **Reach (R)**: <number> — rationale cites §3 Users
- **Impact (I)**: <0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 3> — rationale cites Executive perspective + Problem severity (§2, §8)
- **Confidence (C)**: <0.5 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 1.0> — rationale cites count of TBDs / Open questions (§15)
- **Effort (E)**: <person-weeks> — rationale cites Effort signal from §7
- **RICE = R × I × C / E = <number>**
- **State**: proposed | confirmed

## 12. Feasibility — Claude proposed

- [☑/☐] **Tech**: <rationale — cite adjacent feature from repo scan>
- [☑/☐] **Skills**: <rationale>
- [☑/☐] **Time**: <rationale — cite similar past feature shipping time>
- **State**: proposed | confirmed

## 13. Recommendation
**Selected: Approach <X>** — <3-5 sentence rationale>

Rationale MUST cite:
- RICE score from §11
- Feasibility state from §12
- ≥1 multi-perspective cell from §8
- ≥1 competitive gap from §6

**Locked-in pointer**: <what this commits us to for write-spec phase>

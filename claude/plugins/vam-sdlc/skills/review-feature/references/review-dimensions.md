# Review dimensions + dispatch

The independent review (protocol step 2) probes the feature diff along these dimensions. For a
small change, one [`vam-sdlc:reviewer`](../../../agents/reviewer.md) pass covers them all; for a large
diff, fan out one reviewer per dimension and merge findings.

## Stage 1 — does it do what the PRD says (the gate that can block ship)

- **AC compliance.** For every AC the change claims (the `SDLC-AC` trailers / `tasks/tasks.json`
  `acs`): does the code actually produce the business-observable outcome the AC names, and is
  there a test that asserts *that outcome* (not a tautology)?

- **End-to-end user-story + AC trace (the backstop).** Take the **whole** PRD **§4 user-story set
  + §5 AC set** — **not only the ACs the diff claims** — and trace both through the chain.
  **Use-case level:** every §4 user story has ≥1 AC (write-prd's use-case floor) and a §6
  sequence flow (complete-sequence-diagrams' use-case pass). **AC level:**
  **PRD §5 → `sad.md` §6 sequence (a flow or branch shows it) → `data-model.md` (the schema
  supports it) → `contracts/openapi.yaml` (an endpoint/event exposes it) →
  `tasks/tasks.json` (a task claims it) → implement (code + a test asserts it)**.
  The trace spans **every surface declared in `sad.md` `target_surfaces`** — not only the
  backend: for a UI surface (`web-frontend` / `mobile-app` / `desktop-app`) a UI AC must trace
  to a `ui`-layer task **and** a **component / e2e-through-UI** test, and a UI-driven §6 flow
  (`<user>` → `<ui>` → `<service>`) must show it — a UI AC that lands only a backend test is a
  gap. Flag anything that **drops out anywhere** — a user story with no AC or no flow, or an AC
  missing a flow, a task, a test, or code. The per-stage gates each guard one link (write-prd's
  §5 5-type + use-case floors, complete-sequence-diagrams' use-case + AC→flow coverage,
  plan-tests' AC→test, break-tasks' AC→task); `review-feature` is the **end-to-end backstop**
  that catches anything that slipped *between* links and never reached the diff at all.

- **Contract fidelity.** Does the change honour `data-model.md`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, and
  the Accepted ADRs (e.g. the audit-in-transaction decision), or does it quietly diverge?

A stage-1 finding means the feature does not yet meet its PRD — it blocks ship until fixed or
explicitly de-scoped (a PRD change with the owner in the loop). A user story or AC that dropped
out of the chain is a stage-1 finding even if no line of the diff mentions it.

## Stage 2 — is it good code (quality, usually non-blocking)

- **Conventions.** Matches the repo's patterns for each layer (error handling, wiring, naming,
  module boundaries).
- **UI reuse (for a UI surface).** Composes the existing design system / components / tokens /
  styling (`docs/architecture-map.md` §Frontend) rather than reinventing — flag from-scratch UI
  that duplicates an existing primitive or introduces a second styling system.
- **Error + edge handling.** Are the PRD's error / authorization / invariant criteria handled,
  not just the happy path? Concurrency, empty/oversized input, idempotency where the contract
  requires it.
- **Security.** Identity from the session not from input; no new injection/leak surface; secrets
  not logged.
- **Boundary violations.** Stayed inside the module(s) the tasks named; no weakened test; no
  forbidden DB construct vs the repo's migration rules.
- **Test adequacy.** Do the tests exercise the real behaviour, including the failure paths — or
  only the happy path?

## Dispatch shape

The `vam-sdlc:reviewer` agent has read-only tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash`), re-reads
`PRD.md` / contracts / ADRs itself, and emits **cited** findings only:

```
- **[stage-N] <headline>** — file:line; AC: <id|n/a>; problem: <what>; suggested: <fix>.
```

A clean review returns `REVIEW_CLEAN: <scope>`. Drop any finding without a `file:line` +
a concrete reason — it is not actionable. Prioritise correctness and AC-compliance over style;
judge against the artifacts, not personal taste (if the PRD says hide-existence, a 404-style
response is correct, not a bug).

Per [`../../_shared/agent-roster.md`](../../_shared/agent-roster.md): `vam-sdlc:reviewer` runs
`model: opus` / `effort: high`; the dispatch call is `subagent_type: "vam-sdlc:reviewer"`.
If unavailable at runtime, fall back to the general-purpose (or `Explore`) agent, passing the
same prompt with the inline paths and the stage-1 / stage-2 probes above.

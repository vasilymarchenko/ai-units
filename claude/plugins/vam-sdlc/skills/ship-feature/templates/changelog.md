# Changelog — <slug>

<!-- instruction: what changed + why, not a file list. Link the PRD and the load-bearing ADRs.
Include the operational note (migrations, feature flags) the deployer needs. Keep it readable by
someone who didn't write the feature. -->

## <slug> — <one-line summary>

**What:** <the user-facing capability that now exists, in plain language>.

**How to use:** <the endpoint/flow + an example, from [openapi.yaml](../contracts/openapi.yaml)>.

**Operational notes:**

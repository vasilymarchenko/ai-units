# TDD loop — the per-task cycle (step 8)

Every task runs `SELECT → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → GATE → COMMIT` — RED in `vam-sdlc:test-author`, GREEN in `vam-sdlc:implementer`, REFACTOR in the isolated `vam-sdlc:refactor`, GATE + COMMIT on the engine. This is the same cycle whether the runner is the sequential agent, a team, or a Workflow stage. The RED step is the load-bearing one — skip its discipline and the whole method collapses into "write code, write a test that happens to pass".

## SELECT

Pick the next task whose `deps` are all `done`. In sequential mode that's the topo order; in parallel modes the orchestrator hands it out. Read the task body + its `acs` from `docs/features/<slug>/PRD.md §5` + the relevant `test-plan.md` rows. Know, before writing anything, what observable outcome the test will assert.

The selection set comes from `docs/features/<slug>/tasks/tasks.json` (loaded once in step 1) — honour the `deps` DAG and the serialization lanes (`layer: migration` serialized in ordinal order; overlapping `files_hint` → same lane; `layer: ui` parallelizes unless its `files_hint` overlaps). When a task moves to `done`, update `docs/features/<slug>/tasks/tracker.md`.

### Migration tasks promote first

A `layer: migration` task does its promotion **before** RED: copy each staged `docs/features/<slug>/migrations/<NN>_*` pair (in ascending ordinal order) into the repo's live migrations tree, re-stamping the number/timestamp at promote-time per the repo's convention so the live sequence stays correct (verbatim SQL — never rewritten). Then the task's RED→GREEN proves «the promoted migration applies and reverts cleanly» against the ephemeral DB. Full rules → [`./inputs.md`](./inputs.md). A migration task with no staged file is a `break-tasks`/`generate-data-model` mismatch — surface it, never invent SQL.

## RED — write the failing test first

1. Write the test(s) for this task's `acs` **before any production code**. Put them where the repo keeps tests for that layer (detected, not assumed).
2. Run the unit command. Capture the output.
3. **Classify the first run** — this is mandatory and must be stated aloud:

   | Class | What it looks like | Action |
   |---|---|---|
   | **GOOD red** | test compiles, runs, fails on an assertion or «not implemented» | proceed to GREEN |
   | **BAD red** | the test itself won't compile / import-errors / references a symbol that the test got wrong | the test is broken, not the code — **fix the test**, re-run, re-classify |
   | **false-pass** | green on the very first run, before any production code | the test is too weak (asserts nothing real) — **strengthen it** until it's GOOD red |
   | **NON-red** | skipped because its dependency is unavailable (e.g. Docker absent for an integration test) | not a pass and not a fail — record NON-red, governed by `require_integration` |

4. **Quote the failing line** (the assertion + expected-vs-actual, or the «undefined: X» line) before writing any production code. This is the proof that the test exercises the right thing.

A task with only a NON-red integration test and no unit coverage cannot be driven by TDD locally — write the unit-level RED too, and let the integration RED land in CI (the proving-run pattern).

## GREEN — minimal code to pass

Write the **least** code that turns the quoted failing assertion green. No speculative generality, no unrelated edits, nothing outside the task's `files_hint`. Re-run the unit command; confirm the previously-quoted failure is now green and nothing else broke.

## REFACTOR — clean while staying green

Delegated to the isolated `vam-sdlc:refactor` agent (GREEN is `vam-sdlc:implementer`'s). Tidy names, extract helpers, remove duplication — re-running the unit command after each change. If a refactor goes red and isn't trivially fixable, **revert it**; the task's job is the GREEN, not the cleanup. No new behaviour, never touch a test.

## GATE — the task isn't done until this is clean

Run, per the detected commands + settings:

- **unit** — must be green.
- **integration** — green if available; NON-red recorded if Docker is absent under `require_integration: auto`; BLOCK was already enforced for `always`.
- **lint** (if `gate_lint` and a linter resolved) — clean.
- **vet/typecheck** (if `gate_vet` and a command resolved) — clean.

Any hard-gate failure (unit red, or integration red when it ran, or lint/vet errors) → the task is not done. Fix, or escalate (see [`escalation.md`](./escalation.md)).

## COMMIT — task-scoped, traceable

When `auto_commit: per_task`, commit only this task's files with a message like:

```
<type>(<slug>): <task title>

<one-line what + why>

SDLC-Task: T3
SDLC-AC: AC-02
SDLC-AC: AC-04
```

One `SDLC-AC` trailer per AC the task satisfied; the `SDLC-Task` trailer ties the commit to `docs/features/<slug>/tasks/tasks.json`. Then mark the task `done` in `tasks/tracker.md`. (`per_phase` batches a phase's tasks into one commit; `off` leaves committing to the user but still updates the tracker.)

In parallel modes the **lead serializes commits in dependency order** even though the work happened concurrently — the history stays linear and bisectable.

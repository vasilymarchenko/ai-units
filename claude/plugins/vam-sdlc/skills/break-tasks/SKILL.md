description: >
  Use to break a designed feature into atomic, ≤1-day tasks with a dependency graph, a
  per-task Definition of Done, and a machine-readable tasks.json that the implement-tasks engine
  consumes. Triggers on "task breakdown for {slug}", "break down tasks for {slug}",
  "tasks for {slug}", "plan the work for {slug}", "sprint plan for {feature}", "stage 13 for {slug}",
  "/vam-sdlc:break-tasks {slug}". Reads PRD.md + sad.md + Accepted ADRs (+ data-model + openapi if present),
  writes docs/features/{slug}/tasks/{_epic,tracker,<task>}.md AND docs/features/{slug}/tasks/tasks.json.
  Tracker export to any issue tracker is optional and tool-neutral. Hard-refuses if PRD.md or sad.md
  or an Accepted ADR is missing. Stories LINK to upstream artefacts (PRD AC §, SAD §6, data-model,
  openapi), they do not duplicate them.

# Skill: break-tasks (SDLC stage 13)

Task-breakdown generator: atomic tasks ≤1 day, each a separately reviewable change (≤~500 LOC preferred), with a visible dependency graph and a Definition of Done per task. One task = one focused Claude session = one PR. "Build the feature" is not a task — break it down.

Task files **link** to upstream artefacts (`PRD.md §AC-N`, `sad.md §6 UC-N`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, `adr/NNNN-*.md`) — they do not duplicate them. Alongside the human-facing markdown, this skill emits **`tasks.json`**, the contract the `implement-tasks` engine reads to build its dependency DAG.

This is the **stage 13 runner** and the keystone that closes the cycle: the markdown is for humans, the `tasks.json` is the machine handoff to `implement-tasks`.

## When to use

- "task breakdown for <slug>", "break down tasks for <feature>", "sprint plan for <feature>", "run stage 13".
- User has PRD + sad.md + Accepted ADRs and is about to start implementation (or create tickets in Jira / Linear / Issues).
- `/vam-sdlc:break-tasks <slug>` as explicit invocation.
- Skip if the task-breakdown already exists and `implement-tasks` is mid-run.

## Inputs

- `<slug>` — feature slug.
- **Gate (hard refuse):** `docs/features/<slug>/PRD.md` + `docs/features/<slug>/sad.md` + ≥1 Accepted ADR in `adr/`. Missing → STOP and point at the producing skill (`write-prd` / `architecture-design` / `decide-adr`).
- Read directly (not via an index): PRD §5 AC + §6 NFR, sad §5 module boundaries + §6 runtime + §9 ADR index, each Accepted ADR, and — if present — `data-model.md` and `contracts/openapi.yaml`.

## Protocol

1. **Prereq check (hard).** `test -f docs/features/<slug>/PRD.md && test -f docs/features/<slug>/sad.md && ls docs/features/<slug>/adr/*.md` → exit ≠ 0 = refuse with the missing artefact named.
2. **Read upstream directly.** PRD §5 AC + §6 NFR (what to deliver), sad.md §5 module boundaries (task scope) + §6 runtime flows + §9 ADR index, each Accepted ADR (constraints), data-model.md (invariants if DB), openapi.yaml (contract). No intermediate index — each task links back to the section it derives from.
3. **Scaffold output.** `mkdir -p docs/features/<slug>/tasks/` → create `tasks/_epic.md` (summary + links + the DAG `flowchart`), `tasks/tracker.md` (status table), one `tasks/<task-slug>.md` per task. Templates → [`./templates/_epic.md`](./templates/_epic.md), [`./templates/tracker.md`](./templates/tracker.md), [`./templates/task.md`](./templates/task.md). **Validate the `_epic.md` `flowchart` per [`../_shared/mermaid-check.md`](../_shared/mermaid-check.md)** (render-parse with `mmdc` if available, else the structural lint; fix before committing).
4. **Identify work-items by layer.** Generic, stack-agnostic layers: `migration` (DB) · `domain` (entities/invariants) · `infra` (repo/persistence) · `app` (service/use-case) · `ports` (handler/API) · `ui` (UI components / screens / view-state — only when a UI surface is declared) · `tests` · `wiring` (composition/DI) · `docs`. **`sad.md` frontmatter `target_surfaces` gates which layers appear** (→ [`../_shared/surfaces.md`](../_shared/surfaces.md)): a `web-frontend` / `mobile-app` / `desktop-app` surface adds `ui` tasks; a backend-only feature emits domain/infra/app/ports (no `ui`); a `cli` feature app/ports; a `worker` domain/infra. Each `ui` task **names the existing components / tokens / styling it reuses** (from `architecture-map.md` §Frontend) — a *new* component is listed only when no existing primitive fits. List 8–20 items by size (see [`../_shared/size-matrix.md`](../_shared/size-matrix.md)).
5. **Atomic check.** Each task ≤1 working day. More → split. A change >~500 LOC is a smell that the task is too wide.
6. **Dependency graph.** For each task, `deps: [...]`. Identify parallel branches (e.g. the migration and a pure-domain task can start together). This graph IS the DAG `implement-tasks` will topologically sort into phases.
7. **Per-task DoD.** Each task is testable: «unit tests for the new validation pass», «migration applies and reverts cleanly», «handler returns the PRD'd outcome for AC-03». No subjective «done when I say so».
8. **AC refs + files hint.** Each task lists the `acs` it satisfies (PRD §5 IDs) and a `files_hint` — the directories/files it will touch. `files_hint` lets `implement-tasks` serialize tasks whose file sets overlap, and `layer: migration` is always serialized (ordered migration sequence); `layer: ui` is **not** auto-serialized — UI tasks parallelize unless their `files_hint` overlaps. A migration task's `files_hint` is the **staged** pair `docs/features/<slug>/migrations/<NN>_*` (which `implement-tasks` promotes into the live `migrations/` when it runs the task) — not a live `migrations/` path.
9. **Estimate + owner.** S/M/L or hours; a named owner (or `<TBD lead>`). Adapt to the team's sizing if any (S = 2h, M = half-day, L = day, otherwise split).
10. **Emit `tasks.json`** (step contract below) — the same model the markdown reflects, in machine form, at `docs/features/<slug>/tasks/tasks.json`.
11. **Optional tracker export.** If an issue-tracker MCP is connected (Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues / Redmine — whichever the repo uses), offer to create tickets from `_epic.md` + the task files. Otherwise provide copy-paste-ready bodies. Never hard-bind to one tracker.
12. **Self-check.** Every task ≤1 day; DAG acyclic with ≥1 parallel branch where the work allows; DoD per task; `acs` cover every PRD §5 AC; `tasks.json` validates against the contract.
13. **Propose commit + handoff.** `13: task-breakdown for <slug> (breakdown + tasks.json)`. Then **emit the stage-handoff block** per [`../_shared/handoff.md`](../_shared/handoff.md) — *What I did* + *Review* (`tasks/`, `tasks/tasks.json`) + *Run next* (`/clear`, then `/vam-sdlc:plan-tests <slug>`, then `/vam-sdlc:implement-tasks <slug>`).

## `tasks.json` contract (read by `implement-tasks`)

```json
{
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T1",
      "title": "imperative, specific",
      "layer": "migration|domain|infra|app|ports|ui|tests|wiring|docs",
      "deps": ["T0"],
      "acs": ["AC-01", "AC-02"],
      "dod": "one testable sentence",
      "files_hint": ["path/or/dir/the/task/touches"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- The markdown task files and `tasks.json` use the **same field names** (`deps`, `acs`) — this skill emits both from one model, so there's no translation layer to drift.
- `deps` must form a **DAG** (no cycles) and reference only ids present in the file. The DAG edges are the `deps` arrows; the `_epic.md` `flowchart` renders the same edges.
- **Serialization lanes** (how `implement-tasks` reads the DAG): `layer: migration` tasks are serialized into the ordered migration sequence; `layer: ui` is **not** auto-serialized (UI tasks parallelize); tasks with overlapping `files_hint` are serialized into the same lane regardless of layer. Everything else with no shared lane and satisfied `deps` runs in parallel within a phase.
- Which layers are present is gated by `sad.md` frontmatter `target_surfaces` (a UI surface adds `ui`; a backend-only feature has none) → [`../_shared/surfaces.md`](../_shared/surfaces.md).

## Questions for discussion

- Dependencies between tasks (the DAG)?
- What parallelizes — which branches start together?
- DoD per task?
- Who is the owner?
- Estimate (S/M/L or hours)?

## Definition of Done

- `tasks/_epic.md` + `tasks/tracker.md` + one `tasks/<task>.md` per task exist, linking (not duplicating) upstream.
- `tasks/tasks.json` exists and validates: acyclic `deps`, every `acs` entry is a real PRD §5 AC, every task has a `dod` and a `files_hint`.
- Every task ≤1 day with an owner; the DAG shows ≥1 parallel branch where the work allows.
- Every PRD §5 AC is covered by ≥1 task's `acs`.
- Each task = reviewable PR (≤~500 LOC preferred).

## Anti-patterns

- **«Build the feature»** as one task. Break into ≥8 atomic ones.
- **5-day monster tasks** → unreviewable. Split.
- **No dependencies** → parallel starts that block each other the next day.
- **No per-task DoD** → «done when I decide».
- **No owner** → nobody starts, or everyone assumes the other will.
- **Sizing without reference (S/M/L).** If the team has no calibration — S = 2h, M = half-day, L = day, otherwise split.
- **Hard-binding to one tracker** (Jira-only language). Export is optional and tool-neutral.
- **Task body duplicates PRD AC / sad §6 / data-model verbatim** — link, don't paste.
- **`tasks.json` out of sync with the markdown** — they must reflect the same model.
- **A task that violates a Hard Rule** from PRD §6 NFR / sad §11 (e.g. «edit another module» when the architecture forbids it).
- **A `ui` task that recreates an existing primitive** (Button/Card/modal) or introduces a second styling system instead of composing `architecture-map.md` §Frontend.
